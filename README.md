# Tailored Knits
###### Modify sweater patterns for a personalized fit with the help of Tailored Knits.
Lynsey Powell

## Inspiration
I am an avid (maybe obsessed) knitter. I love modifying, customizing, and creating sweaters for myself and friends. Creating a well-fitting garment requires attention to details and keeping track of you project. In the knitting online space there is currently not a site that can be used for modifying patterns. I wanted to demonstrate the use of React and create something I will use.
