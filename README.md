# Tailored Knits
###### Modify sweater patterns for a personalized fit with the help of Tailored Knits.
Lynsey Powell

## Inspiration
I am an avid (maybe obsessed) knitter. I love modifying, customizing, and creating sweaters for myself, friends, and family. Creating a well-fitting garment requires keeping track of measurement and fabric details, adjusting as you go. In the knitting online space there is currently not a site that can be used for modifying patterns and tracking these details. I wanted to demonstrate the use of React and create a tool I can use and share with the knitting community.
